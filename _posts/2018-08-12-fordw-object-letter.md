Friends of Russia Dock Woodland and Friends of Stave Hill have made the decision to submit a joint objection to Southwark Council against the K1 development proposed by British Land at Roberts Close. The current proposal is a six story building containing 84 flats which boarders the woodland and ecology park. We feel that the scale, and the density of units within the proposed building will adversely impact the woodland ecology and in turn its users, and are asking for the development to be scaled down to fit in with the suburban layout of the local area.

You can find the objection letter which raises all our concerns regarding the development proposal at the following links:
