It has taken almost three years to complete all five bridge sculptures, with Redriff School being the first, followed by St Johns, Alfred Salter, and Albion St.
 The Friends of Russia Dock Woodland acquired the funding for all five statues through three funding avenues. Namely- southwark councils Cleaner Greener Safer funding. The Bridgehouse Trust, and the North Southwark Environmental Trust.
 
In the photograph are the pupils of Peter Hills who helped design and make the sculptures, by attending a half day session at the surrey docks farm forge to get a hands on experience in working and manipulating metal under intense heat . 
kevin boys (blacksmith) and his team are also in the photo.
 
We feel that this long term project is a fine example of how you can involve local young children in not only designing but also creating works of art that can be seen by all.  The younger generation must feel part of the make up of their area and have say in what goes into it. This is a long term solution into cutting out vandalism and crime. Not one bridge sculpture has been vandalised over the three years. This was very well received by the green flag status judges last week, and has also been seen as a great idea and one that will be used by the head teacher of a school in scotland who has seen the school bridge project on our website.
