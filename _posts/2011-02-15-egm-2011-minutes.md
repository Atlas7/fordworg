### Present
Steve Cornish, Chair, (SC) Ben Dewhurst, Treasurer (BD), John Wills, Secretary (JW), Rebekah Clarke, Tony Horrod

### Agenda 

SC said that the purpose of the meeting was to arrange for the removal of David Meagher as a signatory from the “Friends” bank account. BD said that as David was in ill health and had moved away from the area there was a potential problem with signing cheques now that it was impossible to contact him. It was proposed to remove David Meagher’s signature from the list of approved signatories.

SC said it was proposed to add John Wills to the list of approved signatories and that it was a requirement of the Co-operative Bank that a minuted meeting should he held to arrange this. He then asked JW if he was prepared to take on the responsibility. JW agreed to become a signatory.

BD said there was some urgency in that “Awards for All” had written to remind him that there was a deadline for the receipt of completed forms.

It was agreed to reconvene on 16th February to complete the necessary forms.

### Any other Business

There being no other business, the meeting closed at 18.00
