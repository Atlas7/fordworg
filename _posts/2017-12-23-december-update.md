### Borehole

The new 87 metre deep borehole is ready and lined with pipe. We are now excitedly awaiting the delivery of the new pump and the installation of the electrics. All should be ready for switching on in January!  

### New bridges for the woodland

Work has now begun on the renewal of two of the footbridges within the park, Albion and Alfred Salter bridges. Works will take six to eight weeks until completion. The new footbridges will incorporate their original metal work sculptures (by the local schools) and railings.

### Carp

The Carp removed last year from Globe Pond by Mid Kent Fisheries are soon to be returned with a clean bill of health after their quarantine and will released back into Canada Water Dock.
