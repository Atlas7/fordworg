After the Green Flag Raising Ceremony on Friday 9th some committee members & friends went on a walkabout to determine any problems or things that needed doing. This is something that is done on a regular basis by Friends but this time we were joined by Southwark Park officers Andy Chatterton & Andrea Pitt. We passed Globe Pond which is looking truly magnificent and followed the waterway in the direction of Joe’s Pond. As we came to the bridge by the next pond we saw nine newly hatched ducklings trapped on a floating reed island. A ring of wire netting had been attached to the island to keep predators away. Unfortunately, the mother duck had made her nest behind the wire and although she could get out, her babies were trapped. She was looking on helplessly and there is no doubt the ducklings would have died had we not noticed their plight. A volunteer went off to the Stave Hill hu , donned a pair of waders and they were rescued. Last seen mother and all babies were doing well.
Please keep your eye open during the breeding season and if you see anything like this in future, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. All the details are on this website
