Russia Dock Woodland has been the recipient of the Mayor’s Safer Parks award for three years running now up to and including 2012. In each case we have been given a silver award.The Mayor’s Award is a new and exciting way to celebrate our best social spaces. 

The awards are presented to Friends of Parks groups who have worked in partnership with councils and the police to target anti-social behaviour and revitalise local parks. . 

Since the FRDW  was set up in 2004, the woodland has been transformed. Anti-social behaviour has been banished and it is now popular with thousands of users.

                           “London boasts some of the most sublime green spaces in the country, and everyone deserves to enjoy their local parks without fear of crime. The scheme recognises the tireless work many unsung local heroes put into making green spaces more pleasant for everyone."
