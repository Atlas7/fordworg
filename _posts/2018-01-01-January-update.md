### New borehole and Pump

We are pleased to say the new borehole and pump are functioning perfectly and are now supplying a constant flow of clean fresh water from the aquifer to the southern ponds. We will be temporarily reducing the water flow into the northern section of the park, due to the Albion Bridge renewal that's in progress, Conways will need dry conditions further up the stream to lay the bridge foundations. There will be no impact to the major ponds, Globe and Mahogany will be maintained at their usual levels.   

### New footbridges for the woodland

Work has begun on rebuilding Albion bridge and Alfred Salter bridge the works are on schedule to be completed by ..
All of the local schools bridge metal work sculptures have been safely removed and stored, they will be spruced up and repainted ready to be re-attached to the new bridge structure once complete.

### Pond Wiers 
Plans are in progress to renew the five weirs on the Northern Section of the Waterways System leading down from Globe Pond to Joes Pond. Works are hoped to be carried out by The Conservation Volunteers Biodiversity Team, who have completed a number of different construction projects within the woodland and ecology park including new pathways, steps and Bob's Shed.
